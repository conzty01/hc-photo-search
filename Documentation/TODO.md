- [x] Work on finding a way to retrigger the indexing process from the UI
- [x] Admin page: Add ability to manually edit JSON for individual orders (save to filesystem and Meilisearch)
- [x] The "copy path" button does not copy the correct path for me to paste into Windows Explorer.
- [x] The UI currently truncates options with "+4 options" or whatever. We should be able to expand the list to show all options.
- [x] The UI could be a bit more fun.
- [x] We don't need the "photos" pill in the search results. It's not helpful.
- [x] dark mode
- [x] The worker should not be concerned with adding single character keywords to the JSON slug (like "x" from "42 x 52" for example).
- [x] When looking at a search result, it would be nice to be able to click an edit icon and have that open up the admin page for that specific order.
- [x] Persist search state in URL so back button restores search results after navigating away.
- [x] Not all orders with comments are custom orders, but all custom orders should have order comments. See example orders for more info.
- [x] We need to develop a workflow for bringing in new orders. What I mean is that, we need to detect when we are indexing a new order for the first time and attempt to parse the options and keywords. If this is a custom order, then we should flag it or something so that the next time the user comes to the application, they can see that there is a custom order they should review and can update the options and keywords. Once they complete this work, the changes should save to the filesystem and Meilisearch.
- [x] In the admin page, would it be possible for us to modify the primary color in-app rather than having it hard-coded in the CSS?
- [x] Can we add a button to the order JSON editor card that would have the system reindex that specific order with information from Volusion? The reindex should update the JSON file and Meilisearch and keep the order pulled up in the editor. Obviously the editor should update with the latest information when it loads. The user should also be prevented from making changes whie the re-index takes place.
- [x] The worker class needs to be updated so that it runs at 4am every day.
- [x] Update the worker so that words like "and", "an", and "the" are not included in the keywords.
- [x] Get a repo created in GitHub for this.
    - [ ] Add a readme which explains what this project is for, that it uses AI for development and what my process was for creating the project with AI.
